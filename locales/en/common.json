      "question": "Do I have to expect a delivery charge?",
      "answer": "Shipping is always free of charge unless you live in a country where our packages have frequently been lost in the process. In that case, a mandatory tracking charge of EUR 2.50 applies to make sure your crate arrives safely. You can see whether you are affected by this on the checkout page."
    },

      "question": "Which art supplies will be in the crate?",
      "answer": "That’s a surprise and part of the excitement of Upcrate! You’ll never know what is going to be inside before it arrives, but you can be certain that you’ll discover new, high quality art supplies you might love."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many items will be in each crate?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is there a cut-off date?",
      "answer": "Each month we have a cut-off date to ensure we can plan for all the boxes to be packed and shipped. All subscribers that start with their Upcrate after this date will be added to the subscriber list for the next month."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until I get my crate?",
      "answer": "Your boxes will be shipped around the 15th of the month. Once your crates have been shipped out, we will notify you. It will take about 4-8 days for subscribes in Europe and 10-15 days to reach international subscribers."
    },
    {
      "question": "I’d love to gift this box to a relative or friend! Is that possible?",
      "answer": "Yes! Just click the “gift” option in your cart and fill out your invoice address and the delivery address of the person you want to surprise with Upcrate. Your loved one is going to receive their box with the next batch of boxes we ship out into the world… and they’ll even find a Captain Crate card with their name and yours inside!"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a gift box and a regular subscription?",
      "answer": "Gift boxes are an one-time order, meaning that there is no subscription to this option that would automatically renew itself."
